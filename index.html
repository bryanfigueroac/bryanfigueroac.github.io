        <p>

            My name is Bryan Figueroa and I am 22 years-old and currently work in acounting. Some fun things that I am into are playing video games (love Smash Bros), work out to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and coding becasue I love creating new things! <br /><br />One of the main reasons I got into tech was from a class I took in Highschool where we would make basic websites and simple games/animations using a program called Greenfoot. I've always been into computers since my fmaily got one back when I was 8 years-old. I loved the idea of the world wide web and what types of things you could do with a computer. I've always been the go-to person in my family to help fix any issues with their computers ever since I was a young boy I would always help without hesitation. <br /><br /> Another hobby that I have gotten into is building computers from scratch; I have built over 10 computers with many different parts since I was in 10th grade.
